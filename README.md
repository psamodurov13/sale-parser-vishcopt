# Price parser for discounted goods from the supplier's website

Prices on the supplier's website are displayed only for logged in users. The program collects a list of products from the sales categories. Then we get the wholesale price without discount and the wholesale price with discount.

According to the established rule, we calculate the value of the retail price. We update the information in the file with products and create an xml file with the received data. File is available on Google Drive (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElPAIUzrT3n6CzW9rKzdOZC_PakxYxSF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104681737820453019553&rtpof=true&sd=true). File must be placed in the project folder
